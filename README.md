# KAFKA

This repo relates to learning Apache Kafka with Quarkus, a Java framework.

## 📌 Step-by-Step Roadmap to Learn Apache Kafka

To master Kafka, you need to understand its **core concepts, installation, producer-consumer model, advanced features, and real-time data processing**.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Introduction to Apache Kafka

✅ **What is Kafka and Why is it Important?**

- Kafka is a **distributed streaming platform**
- It is used for **real-time data processing and microservices communication**
- Works on the **publish-subscribe (Pub/Sub) model**

✅ **Key Components of Kafka**

- **Producer** → Sends data to Kafka
- **Broker** → Stores data
- **Consumer** → Reads data from Kafka
- **Topic** → Organizes data into categories
- **Zookeeper** → Manages Kafka cluster

✅ **Kafka vs Other Messaging Systems** (ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Pulsar)

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Installing and Setting Up Kafka

✅ **Install Kafka on Your System (Windows/Linux/Mac)**

- Download and set up Kafka
- Start **Zookeeper and Kafka Server**
- Run Kafka **Topics, Producers, and Consumers using CLI**

✅ **Learn Kafka CLI Commands**

- **Create, List, and Delete Topics**
- **Send Data using Producer**
- **Consume Data using Consumer**

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Understanding Kafka Producer and Consumer

✅ **Producer API**: Sending data to Kafka  
✅ **Consumer API**: Reading data from Kafka  
✅ **Consumer Groups and Offset Management**  
✅ **Message Retention Policy and Partitioning**  

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Learning Advanced Kafka Features

✅ **Partitioning & Replication**: Ensuring **high availability** and **scalability**  
✅ **Kafka Streams API**: Processing streaming data  
✅ **Kafka Connect API**: Connecting Kafka with **databases and external systems**  
✅ **Security** (SSL, SASL, Authentication & Authorization)  

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Using Kafka with Java & Spring Boot

✅ **Building Kafka Producer and Consumer in Spring Boot**  
✅ **Handling JSON Data in Kafka**  
✅ **Error Handling and Logging in Kafka**  

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Real-World Kafka Projects & Best Practices

✅ **IoT Data Processing** (Sensor Data Streaming)  
✅ **Stock Market Real-time Data Processing**  
✅ **E-commerce Order Processing System**  
✅ **Log Aggregation & Monitoring System**
